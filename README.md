## Installation

Just clone or download this repo. This is not a package (yet, maybe someday :-))

## Usage

The project has a command line interface (CLI) managed by a script named `bohr_turtle.py`. In the terminal prompt:

```bash
$ python bohr_turtle.py
```

Follow the instructions in the screen, inserting how many levels do you want and how many electrons in each level. The gif at the beginning of this README is for a mercury atom, so:

![usage_example](usage_example.png)

A window will show with the animated turtle drawing each level. After the drawing is finished, just click the window to go back to the terminal.

## Under the hood - requirements

Python 3.6 or higher. The [`turtle` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is part of the standard library.
